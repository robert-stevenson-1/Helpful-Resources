## CAD

Specific or General CAD resources can go here.

### [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

As a general point [MangoJelly Solutions for FreeCAD](https://www.youtube.com/@MangoJellySolutions) has some nice tutorials on YouTube, but some can be long to watch sometimes but are generally helpful

:warning:It is important to point out that FreeCAD currently has an issue called the Topological naming problem (Read more on it [here](https://wiki.freecad.org/Topological_naming_problem)), but **in general the "use of supporting datum objects like planes and local coordinate systems is strongly recommended to produce models that aren't easily subject to such topological errors" and in the case of using "TechDraw, the user is advised to add dimensions only when the 3D model is complete and won't be modified further."**
More in on this in the link prior (with an example illustrating the issue), and it is one of the big fixes in the next release of FreeCAD.:warning:

#### Videos

- [CAD TUTORIAL : FreeCAD Beginner [EASY GUIDE]](https://youtu.be/1QNVyMBV0fM?si=eomzC8haWfdwZD_3)
  - A gental *get right into it* type of tutorial. No need to spend 30+ min per workbench to learn all it's option and UI as that gets boring fast
- [Learn How To Build a Spreadsheet Driven Model in 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/ij-W5ugn2uw?si=UVVrypASzIAjdIS5)
  - Personally I like the power of controlling my models design parameters from a spreadsheet as it quicker then digging trough the Object tree and Sketches to change just one thing
- [Assembly 4 Workbench](https://youtu.be/B0gXZv_3L-E?si=ut_eM3OJhQlb-BhV)
  - **Rob**; Yet to watch this  

#### Text

- [FreeCAD Wiki - Tutorials](https://wiki.freecad.org/Tutorials) 
  - I mean they are tutorials that FreeCAD themselves have listed, so they are generally nice to look at.
- [Assembly 4 Workbench](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Assembly4/tree/master/Examples)
  - [The tutorials where moved here](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/tree/master), but this now includes a few more then before
  - Some examples on how to use the workbench from the creator of the Workbench themselves, so.... :ok_hand:

## [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) and PCB Design

KiCad themselves have a list of resources for learning [here](https://www.kicad.org/help/learning-resources/).

The one in this Doc might overlap in this case. 

Also KiCad 6 and KiCad 7 aren't that different so tutorial about either are more easily transferable (at least to me (**Rob**)).

### Video

- [Kicad Beginner Tutorial- A Traffic Light for Arduino](https://youtu.be/EPH23zhPg50?si=EzFuKsYTLuNj0Nfr)
  - Casual Tutorial that aim to get the basics down, with a very simple PCB
- [Phil's Lab]()
  - **Rob**; In general I like Phil's Lab as he has a lot of content focused on various electronic designs (but does tend to use *Altium* as his main Design software)
  - [KiCad STM32 + USB + Buck Converter PCB Design (Using KiCad)](https://youtu.be/C7-8nUU6e3E?si=vvwOcpwOFo9jFrPM)
  - [KiCad 6 STM32 PCB Design Full Tutorial](https://youtu.be/aVUqaB0IMh4?si=8Zq8cnBKMCl3L_PU)

### Text
- [Another KiCad Tutorial - ATSAMD10-based Dev-Board](https://github.com/MalphasWats/hawk#readme)
	- **Dimitris**; This tutorial is entirely on GitHub in text. You follow all the necessary steps to get a working board. As a disclaimer, the KiCad version from 3-4 years ago is not the same as the KiCad version now. The skills are generally transferable. In my experience, the only major change was in how footprints/symbols are imported into KiCad. UI-wise, most functionality has remained untouched. Please use the latest version of KiCad.
- [Digikey - KiCad Beginners Guide](https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/maker/projects/beginners-guide-to-kicad/eb0ae92f5dae49e489f02c10f3edfc60)
  - **Rob**; not used it myself, but Digikey are generally a source that I trust so it's here as an option

## Programming

Generally some good programming tutorial here (not necessarily hardware focused but can be)
